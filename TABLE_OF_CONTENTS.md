## Abstract

Comprehensive economic analysis examining AI's impact across productivity, infrastructure, markets, labor, adoption, regulation, and sustainability. Projects 1.5-3.0% GDP increase by 2035, with $602B annual hyperscaler capex (2026) driving infrastructure buildout. Analysis finds 88% enterprise adoption but only 33% scaling, 85M jobs displaced vs. 97M created (net +12M), and energy consumption potentially reaching 12% of U.S. electricity by 2028. Based on 188 citations from IMF, OECD, Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, MIT, Penn Wharton, and other authoritative sources.
